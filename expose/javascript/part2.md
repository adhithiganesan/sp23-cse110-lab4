1) At line 12, the code will print the value of i which is 3.

2) At line 13, the code will throw an error because discountedPrice is not defined outside of the for loop.

3) Line 14 will print the discounted value of the last item in teh discounted array which is 150.

4) The function will return the discounted array with the discounted prices, which would be [50, 100, 150].

5) At line 12, the console.log statement will print the value of i which is 3.

6) At line 13, the code will throw an error because discountedPrice can't be accessed outside of the for loop where it was declared.

7) At line 14, the code will throw an error because finalPrice was defined in the for loop and can't be accessed outside of that block.

8) The function will return the discounted array with the discounted prices, [50, 100, 150].

9) At line 11, the code will throw an error because i is declared using the keyword "let" so it doesn't exist outside of the for loop.

10) At line 12, the console.log statement will print 3 which is the length of the prices array.

11) The function will return the discounted array with the discounted prices, which would be [50, 100, 150].

12) 
    a. student.name
    b. student['Grad Year']
    c. student.greeting()
    d. student['Favorite Teacher'].name
    e. student.courseLoad[0]

13)
    a. 32; integers map to their exact string representation
    b. 1; integers map to their exact string representation so 3 - 2 was executed
    c. 3; null is converted to a number (0)
    d. 3null; null is turned into a string and concatenated with '3'
    e. 4; true as an integer equals 1 and 3 + 1 = 4
    f. 0; false = 0 and null = 0
    g. 3undefined; the string '3' is concatenated with the string 'undefined'
    h. NaN; 3 is converted to a number but undefined can't be converted to a number so it equals NaN

14) 
    a. True; '2' converted to a number is greater than 1
    b. False; The first digit of 2 is greater than the first digit in 12
    c. True; 2 equals '2' after '2' is converted to a number
    d. False; '2' and 2 are of different types
    e. False; True = 1 and 1 does not equal 2
    f. True; Boolean(2) evaluates to true and true === true is true

15) The == operator performs type conversion if necessary for comparison. The === operator checks if both items being compared have the same type and value.

17) The result will be [2,4,6]. The function modifyArray creates a new array and then iterates through the array that is passed in as a parameter. For each value in the parameter array, it calls the doSomething method with the value as the parameter for the method. The value returned by doSomething is then pushed onto the new array.

19) The output would be, 1,4,3,2
